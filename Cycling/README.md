## Cycling Visualisations

### Interactive Giro d'Italia 2016

This folder contains:
- Python script to download Giro Italia data from official website xml files
- Python script to perform data transformations and produce graphs
- Giro Data scraped using giroScrape.py
- Giro ipynb file - Download file to enable interaction
- Pickle file - contains list of stage names from Giro

The ipython notebook is viewable on github ONLY in static HTML format. This means all the interaction I have built in is unfrotunately not available. Three types of graphs are available through use of radio buttons and any rider or team can be viewed.
Download the notebook, csv and graphGiro.py to experiment with the visuals.
