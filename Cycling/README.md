# Cycling

## Current State

This folder contains:
Python script to download Giro Italia data from official website xml files
Python script to perform data transformations and produce graphs
Giro Data scraped using giroScrape.py
Giro ipynb file - Download file to enable interaction
Pickle file - contains list of stage names from Giro

The ipython notebook is shown viewable on github ONLY in static HTML format. This means all the interaction I have built in is unfrotunately not available. Three types of graphs are available through use of radio buttons and any rider or team can be viewed.
Download the notebook to experiment with the visuals.

## Future Goals

Repeat above scraping scripts and visual notebooks for Tour De France and the Spanish Vuelta
