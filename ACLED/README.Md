## ACLED - Armed Conflict Location and Event Data

The [ACLED](http://www.acleddata.com) project are an organisation within the umbrella of crisis mapping. The goal of the organisation is to provide data and analytics 
on politically motivated events across the African continent and South East Asia. ACLED collect data from a wide variety of in-country sources and
produce real-time analysis and visualisations of political unrest to enhance international understanding of these events.

As part of a piece of work for my MSc Data Science I performed a visual analysis of the changing political climate in Libya. The work produced
showed how visual analysis of high level data could lead a human agent to perform subsequent micro analysis, finding increasingly detailed information 
from each subsequent visualisation produced.

The data is available on their website here  -> [ACLED data](http://www.acleddata.com/data/)

PDF contains the visual spatio-temporal anlysis with accompanying narrative.
