## Stock Picks 2016

Every year business analysts working at various journalism organisations will share their stock prediction for the forthcoming year. How much trust should be given to these professional opinions? I've taken a look at two prominent British print media organisations, the Guardian and Telegraph. Both organisations chose 10 stocks to follow through 2016. In addition I've looked at professional brokerage service Hargreaves and Lansdown and judged the performance of their 5 to watch.

This work was motivated by my recent discovery of pandas datareader which allows users in 1 line of code to scrape stock data from yahoo or google finance: https://pandas-datareader.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

Nbviewer of ipython notebooks, all contain individual stock charts, table of stock performance YTD and shared graphs shown below:

- [Telegraph](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/N-Johnston/Visualisations/blob/master/Stock%20Performance/Notebooks/Telegraph%20Stock%20Picks%202016.ipynb)
- [H&L](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/N-Johnston/Visualisations/blob/master/Stock%20Performance/Notebooks/Hargeaves%20Stock%20Picks%202016.ipynb)

As the time of writing, Oct 10th, the two media organisations both have negative portfolios with the Guardian performing particularly poorly. H&L have greatly benefitted from the sale of ARM holdings and thus have an average postive return.

Average Ytd Gains:
Guardian : 9.47%
Telegraph : -0.48%
H&L : +
